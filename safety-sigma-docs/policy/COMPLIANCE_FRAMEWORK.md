## Executive Summary
Safety Sigma employs a **zero-tolerance compliance framework** designed specifically for Trust & Safety intelligence processing. Our approach treats compliance as infrastructure, not behavior, ensuring that critical requirements are enforced at the system level rather than relying on AI model behavior.

### Core Compliance Principles
1. **Zero-Inference Policy**: Only extract information explicitly stated in source documents
2. **Complete Traceability**: Every extracted element linked to exact source location
3. **Hallucination Prevention**: Architectural barriers against synthetic data generation
4. **Regulatory Alignment**: Built-in support for SOC 2, GDPR, and financial services compliance
5. **Audit Transparency**: Immutable trails of all processing decisions and validations
