**Source**: atlas-highlights-scams-and-fraud.pdf  
**Processing Mode**: Zero-inference with exact preservation

## Bundle Contents

### Authoritative Artifacts (Primary)
- `rules/rules.json` - Compiled indicators and rules with span references
- `rules/report.html` - Enhanced analyst-friendly HTML report  
- `tests/` - JUnit validation results for gates V-001 through V-005
- `input/` - Source PDF document for provenance

### Advisory Content (NON-AUTHORITATIVE)
- `advisory/narrative_advisory.md` - Analyst convenience narrative
- `advisory/sources.json` - Span-to-quote mapping for advisory content

### Documentation & Compliance
- `docs/ops/privacy_legal_note_v0.1.md` - Privacy and legal considerations
- `manifest.json` - Bundle metadata and validation gate status

## Validation Gates

The Safety Sigma system enforces five validation gates:

- **V-001**: Indicator preservation (exact verbatim text maintained)
- **V-002**: Category grounding (compiled categories match IR categories)  
- **V-003**: Audit completeness (all indicators have span refs + provenance)
- **V-004**: Practitioner readiness (regex/SQL rules generated)
- **V-005**: Execution guarantees (no UNSPECIFIED values in outputs)

See `manifest.json` for current gate status and evidence availability.

## Advisory Content Disclaimer

⚠️ **NON-AUTHORITATIVE**: The `advisory/` folder contains content for analyst convenience only. It is derived from spans in the authoritative artifacts but should not be treated as a source of truth. Always verify information against:

1. `rules/rules.json` (authoritative IR and compiled rules)
2. `tests/` (validation evidence)  
3. `manifest.json` (gate status and metadata)

## Usage

1. **Review HTML Report**: Open `rules/report.html` for analyst-friendly view
2. **Validate Gates**: Check `manifest.json` for validation status
3. **Deploy Rules**: Use regex/SQL from `rules/rules.json` for detection
4. **Audit Trail**: Trace any indicator back to source via span references

## Processing Methodology

- **Zero-inference**: No behavioral analysis or threat attribution
- **Exact preservation**: Indicators stored verbatim from source
- **Source grounding**: Every claim traceable to specific PDF spans
- **Append-only audit**: Complete processing chain logged
